# Clustering using R
 
The objective of this project is to build a recommendation engine that will group Masters students by their characteristics in terms of fondness of different movie types by using the concept of k-means. 

This grouping is needed to better understand the preferences of students about movie types which would help to place them in suitable slot in the upcoming movie night as organized as a part of Data Science program.

Additionally, it is intended to explore some critical aspects like distributions of ratings by student on different movie types, their correlations etc.
